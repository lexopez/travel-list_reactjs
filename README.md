# 🧳 Far Away – Packing List App

**Far Away** is a simple React.js learning project that helps users create and manage a packing list for a trip. The app is intentionally lightweight and uses **only React local state** to demonstrate core React concepts such as component composition, props, and state updates.

This project is designed purely for **learning purposes** and does not use external state management libraries, databases, or APIs.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The application allows users to:

- Add items needed for a trip
- Specify quantity per item
- Mark items as packed or unpacked
- Remove individual items
- Sort or clear the packing list

All logic is handled locally within React components using `useState`.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **React.js**
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**
- **CSS** for styling

⚠️ No external libraries, global state management, or backend services are used.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

- Using `useState` for local state management
- Passing state and handlers via props
- Controlled form inputs
- Rendering lists dynamically
